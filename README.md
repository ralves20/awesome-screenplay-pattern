# Awesome Screenplay Pattern [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> "The Screenplay Pattern is an innovative, user-centred approach to writing high-quality automated acceptance tests. It steers your team towards effectively using layers of abstraction, helps your test scenarios capture the business vocabulary of your domain, and encourages good testing and software engineering habits.
> 
> Focusing on actors and their goals and incorporating your domain language into test scenarios improves team collaboration and alignment, enabling technical and business stakeholders to understand and readily contribute to the test automation process."
>
> -- From the [Serenity/JS Handbook](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/) by Jan Molak
